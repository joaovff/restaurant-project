# IDEA Restaurant
IDEA is a project developed with the aim of replacing menus with a digital menu. The objective is for the website to be fully adaptable to the restaurant's needs, giving complete autonomy to change the products and information presented. When logged in, the user, who in this case will be an admin of the website, will have access to a Dashboard with statistics on the evaluations of each dish and the possibility of creating, editing or removing dishes from the menu.

# Technologies:
Vanilla Javascript, Handlebards, Nodejs, CSS, Bootstrap.

# Project Status:
Completed and Deployed
